# Boilerplate React-Tailwind 

Welcome to the Boilerplate React-Tailwind repository! 
This project is a sample template for building a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) using React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and Axios. 
It includes essential pages such as Home, Leaves, Login, Rating, and Timeline, with a well-structured codebase and ESLint rules for a consistent coding style.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Vite**: A fast development build tool with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- **ESLint**: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

- **Login**: User authentication page.
- **Rating**: Employee performance rating system.
- **Timeline**: Visual timeline of employee activities and events.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/boilerplate-react-tailwind-hrms.git
cd boilerplate-react-tailwind-hrms
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server with Vite:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the application running with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled.

### Building for Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist` directory.

### Linting

Lint your code with ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

## API Integration

Axios is configured in `src/api/axios.js` to handle API requests. You can import and use it in your components like this:

```javascript
import axios from '../api/axios';

axios.get('/api/endpoint')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('There was an error!', error);
  });
```
